# QueryGenerator_using_LLM

This project is a comprehensive Language Model (LLM) initiative utilizing Google Palm and Langchain. The objective is to create a system capable of interacting with a MySQL database. Users can pose questions using natural language, and the system responds by transforming those inquiries into SQL queries and subsequently executing them on the MySQL database.

### It is an LLM based question and answer system that will use following:
Google Palm LLM
Hugging face embeddings
Streamlit for UI
Langchain framework
Chromadb as a vector store
Few shot learning
